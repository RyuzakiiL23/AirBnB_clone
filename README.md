# Welcome to Our AirBnB Clone Project! 🏠

## Overview 📝

🚀 Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! In this project, we are building an AirBnB clone - a web application that will help us learn and apply various concepts such as creating a Python package, managing objects, serialization, deserialization, and more.

## What's a Command Interpreter? ⌨️

🔍 The command interpreter is a crucial part of our project. It's like a shell, similar to the Shell you might have used before. It allows us to manage AirBnB objects efficiently by performing tasks like creating new objects, retrieving objects, performing operations, updating attributes, and destroying objects.

## Learning Objectives 🧠

✨ By the end of this project, we aim to achieve the following learning objectives:

- Creating a Python package for our project.
- Building a command interpreter using the `cmd` module in Python.
- Implementing unit testing for validating our classes and storage engine.
- Serializing and deserializing classes for file storage.
- Writing and reading JSON files.
- Handling datetime and UUID.
- Understanding and using `*args` and `**kwargs`.
- Managing named arguments in functions.

## Python Scripts 📜

🐍 Our Python scripts follow these guidelines:

- The scripts will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All scripts end with a new line.
- Each script starts with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code follows the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) guidelines.
- All files must be executable.
- Documentation should be present for modules, classes, and functions.

## Python Unit Tests 🧪

🧪 For unit testing, we follow these steps:

- All test files are inside a `tests` folder.
- We use the `unittest` module for testing.
- Test files and folders start with `test_`.
- Tests are executed using `python3 -m unittest discover tests`.
